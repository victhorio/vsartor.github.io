# victhor.io

This repository holds my online "business card" at [victhor.io](https://victhor.io).

I essentially use `@victhor.io` as my email domain, but since some people will naturally want to open the associated website,
I decided to make it a basic one-page "business card". This is a straightforward HTML + CSS + JS page without any frameworks.

It's (self evidently) hosted on GitHub Pages.
